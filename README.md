1) Implement 2 features from the paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873195/) 
visualize the price and the features in the same graph. 
Do a regression based on the features, forecast 1-day ahead
2) Plot (as a line) the regression and expected output, make the plot zoomable. 
Is the regression good? Comment in notebbok
3) Add 2 more features from the “Type 2” category of features presented in the paper (not MA).
4) Calculate the error for the regression, use sMAPE/MAPE and MASE error measurements
5) Design a decision for when to invest and when to sell based on regression.
